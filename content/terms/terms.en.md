## 1. Subject Matter and Scope

These terms of use govern your and our rights and obligations when you use the Wi-Fi access we provide. They apply to everyone who uses our Wi-Fi, regardless of whether the use takes place as an employee, club member, student, or invited guest. The offer is not a publicly accessible telecommunications service but an internal service; use is voluntary, can be revoked at any time, and requires acceptance of these terms. If any provision proves invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.

## 2. Our Services

We provide on our premises a Wi-Fi hotspot for shared, free-of-charge access to the internet. The access serves exclusively to connect to the internet; additional protective measures such as antivirus or firewall software are your responsibility. We do not guarantee any particular transmission speed or uninterrupted availability. Wi-Fi coverage and radio encryption may also vary; in some areas the connection may be unencrypted, which could allow third parties to read the data traffic. Use always takes place within the limits of our technical and operational capabilities.

We reserve the right to modify, restrict, or discontinue access at any time, especially when maintenance or repair work is required. Specific services (e.g., streaming, voice over IP, filesharing) or ports may likewise be blocked if this is necessary to protect the infrastructure or comply with legal obligations. In individual cases, rights holders may request that infringing content be blocked for certain users; such blocks must be proportionate and may only be requested if there is no other way to stop the infringement. We use web filters to limit access to content that is harmful to minors, unlawful, or security-critical.

## 3. Access and Use

Wi-Fi access is intended solely for the defined group of users (e.g., staff, club members, students, or expressly invited guests). There is no entitlement to use; we may restrict or deny access at any time without giving reasons. Use requires registration (if provided) and acceptance of these terms of use and the privacy information, generally via a registration form or a welcome page displayed when the connection is established. We may limit usage time, release access only for specific devices, or make use conditional on additional requirements (e.g., age restrictions). Any changes to the terms of use will be displayed during login; the current version applies in all cases.

## 4. Access Credentials

If credentials such as username, password, or email address are required, we will provide them to you personally or you will choose them during registration. Credentials must be treated confidentially and may not be shared with third parties. You must ensure that only you use your credentials to access the Wi-Fi and that they are protected against unauthorized access at all times. If you suspect your credentials have been compromised, you must notify us immediately so we can block or change them. We reserve the right to modify, deactivate, or reissue credentials at any time.

## 5. Your Obligations as a User

You must provide complete and truthful information during registration or use. You also agree to comply with applicable laws when using our Wi-Fi access. This includes, among others, copyright, trademark, data protection, criminal, and youth protection laws. Ensure that your device is equipped with up-to-date security patches, antivirus software, and a firewall so you do not jeopardize the security of the network or other users. If your device spreads malware or disrupts operation of our Wi-Fi network, we may immediately block your access. If allegations of misuse or illegal activity arise in connection with your Wi-Fi use, you must cooperate in clarifying the facts and provide all information required for that purpose.

## 6. Fees

Use of the Wi-Fi access is currently free of charge. We reserve the right to change this in the future; any fees will be announced in advance and require your renewed consent.

## 7. Service Availability

Because our services are provided free of charge, there is no entitlement to a functioning or continuously available hotspot. We make every effort to enable uninterrupted use but cannot guarantee specific bandwidth, uninterrupted availability, or complete coverage. Interruptions or outages may occur, especially during maintenance, technical adjustments, force majeure, or overload. We may block or restrict access to specific services (e.g., in cases of excessive data use or unlawful conduct) and are not obliged to provide all internet services via the Wi-Fi. Content transmitted by third parties is not part of our service and is not monitored by us.

## 8. Prohibited Conduct

When using the Wi-Fi, any actions that violate applicable law, infringe third-party rights, or disregard youth protection regulations are prohibited. This includes in particular:

- **Unlawful content and services:** Accessing, providing, distributing, promoting, or downloading unlawful, harmful-to-minors, violence-glorifying, discriminatory, or fraudulent content as well as malware or other malicious software. This also covers unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected content (e.g., via filesharing services) and trading in illegal products.
- **Compromising network security:** Transmitting exceptionally large amounts of data, continuous video streaming, hosting your own servers, changing network settings (such as DNS servers), circumventing security or filtering measures, scanning third-party systems, or intercepting data transmissions without authorization. All forms of cyberattacks (e.g., denial-of-service attacks, port scanning, hacking) or automated mass requests are likewise prohibited.
- **Commercial or harassing use:** Sending spam or junk mail, chain letters, phishing or fraudulent messages, or advertising, as well as soliciting other users to disclose passwords or personal data. Operating commercial services (e.g., voice services, telemarketing, video conferencing for third parties) without our explicit approval is also prohibited.
- **Violations of personal rights:** Insulting, defamatory, slanderous, or racist statements and targeted harassment, threats, or discrimination of other users in any communication channel, including email, chat services, and social media.
- **Access to third-party networks or devices:** Attempting to access third-party systems without authorization, circumvent security mechanisms, spy on other devices on the Wi-Fi, or intercept the data traffic of other users. This also includes using the Wi-Fi to operate proxy or VPN servers to conceal illegal activities or bypass geoblocking restrictions.
- **Other abuse:** Any activity likely to impair the proper operation of the Wi-Fi network or connected systems, including spreading false information (“fake news”), using the Wi-Fi for gambling or betting, selling or distributing weapons, drugs, or other illegal goods, or using it for extremist or terrorist propaganda.

## 9. Blocking and Further Measures

We may suspend your Wi-Fi access temporarily or permanently whenever there are concrete indications that you are violating or have violated these terms of use or applicable law. The same applies if we have another legitimate interest in blocking access (e.g., to protect the infrastructure). In cases of serious violations or criminal acts we may share usage data with the competent authorities and file a report; this is based on our need to demonstrate, in the event of a dispute, that third parties used our Wi-Fi. There is no entitlement to reinstatement or replacement of access.

## 10. Indemnification

You are responsible for all actions taken using your credentials or via your device. You indemnify us against all claims made by third parties due to unlawful use of the Wi-Fi or violations of these terms, including the costs of necessary legal defense (attorney and court fees). This obligation remains in place if you allow third parties to use your device or credentials. If claims are imminent or asserted, you must support us immediately in clarifying the facts and provide all information required.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

Our liability for damages is limited as follows:

1. We are fully liable for damages that we cause intentionally or through gross negligence. The same applies to damages resulting from injury to life, limb, or health.
2. In cases of simple negligence we are liable only if an essential contractual obligation (“cardinal duty”) is breached, i.e., an obligation whose fulfillment is essential for proper performance of the contract and on whose observance you regularly rely. In such cases liability is limited to foreseeable damages typical for the contract.
3. Where our liability is excluded or limited by the above provisions, the same applies to our vicarious agents and other persons employed in performing our obligations. Liability under the Product Liability Act remains unaffected.
4. We assume no liability for device damage, loss of data, business interruptions, or lost profit resulting from the use of the Wi-Fi. In particular, we are not liable for unencrypted transmissions or for third-party access to data sent over our Wi-Fi.

## 12. Data Protection and Logging

We collect, store, and process personal data only to the extent necessary to provide the Wi-Fi service or where legally permitted or required. When providing Wi-Fi access we may temporarily log the following data from your device:

- **Traffic data:** MAC and IP address of the device, name of the Wi-Fi network, data volume, date and time of login, and session duration. This data helps prevent misuse, analyze errors, and demonstrate that third parties used the Wi-Fi. It is generally deleted after seven days unless statutory retention obligations require otherwise.
- **Inventory data:** For access that requires registration (e.g., ticket or club access) we may additionally record name, username, purpose of use, activation period, and voluntarily provided contact information (email, telephone). This data is used solely to manage access and is deleted after the usage period ends or once statutory retention periods have expired.

We do not use the data for marketing purposes and will not share it with third parties without your explicit consent, unless we are legally obliged to disclose it (e.g., upon order of investigative authorities). You may, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, request information about the data stored about you at any time, demand correction or deletion, or object to processing. Please refer to our privacy policy for further details.

## 13. Final Provisions

The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies, excluding the provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If you are a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public law, our registered office is the sole place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contractual relationship. We reserve the right to change these terms of use at any time; changes will be published on the welcome page or in another suitable manner. By continuing to use the Wi-Fi after publication, you agree to the amended terms. Should any provision of this contract be or become invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.
