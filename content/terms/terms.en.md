These terms of use govern your rights and obligations and ours in connection with the use of our WiFi access.

## 2. Our Services

- (1) We provide you with access to the internet free of charge in our premises in the form of WiFi access ("hotspot").
- (2) Provision of the hotspot depends on our respective technical and operational capabilities. There is no entitlement to a functioning hotspot or to a particular geographical coverage of the hotspot.
- (3) We also do not guarantee that the hotspot can be used without disruptions or interruptions. Nor can we guarantee any transmission speeds.
- (4) We reserve the right to change, restrict, or discontinue access to the hotspot without prior notice in the event of necessary technical repair and maintenance work.
- (5) There is no entitlement to the use of specific services via the hotspot. In particular, port blocks may be put in place. As a rule, web browsing and sending and receiving emails are enabled.

## 3. Access and Use

- (1) We provide our WiFi only for employees/members/students/special guests of our association. It is not a publicly accessible telecommunications service but an internal WiFi network for our association.
- (2) A prerequisite for use is that you register for use of the hotspot beforehand and/or accept the validity of these terms of use at the start of your use of the hotspot. This can usually be done by selecting the hotspot as the WiFi network on your device and completing the registration form or welcome page that then appears.
- (3) There is no entitlement to use the hotspot. We are free to restrict or discontinue access to the hotspot at any time without giving reasons.
- (4) The version of these terms of use that is current at the time of registration for the hotspot applies.

## 4. Access Data

- (2) If you receive registration data, you must ensure that access to and use of the hotspot with your user data is carried out exclusively by you as the user. If there are facts indicating that unauthorized third parties have gained or will gain knowledge of your access data, you must inform us immediately.
- (3) As the user you are liable, in accordance with statutory provisions, for any use or other activity carried out under your access data.

As a user you are obliged to comply with applicable laws when using the hotspot. In particular, it is prohibited to use the service to retrieve or distribute immoral or unlawful content.
